# Random Trainer Plugin

The Random Trainer plugin selects a skill at random and starts the appropriate microbot plugin.  Currently only mining is supported; other skills are placeholders.

Settings include the delay between switching skills (in minutes), combat training goals for each style, and a heal threshold.  The plugin idles at a bank when the BreakHandler indicates a break is about to start.
